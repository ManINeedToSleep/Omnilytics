
Okay, I have familiarized myself with the `README.md`, `TechStack.md`, and `UserStory.md` files.

Here's a proposed step-by-step plan based on the information in those documents, prioritizing tasks as outlined in `UserStory.md`:

1.  **Foundation & Project Setup:**
    *   Initialize a new Next.js 15 project using `npx create-next-app@latest`.
    *   Integrate Tailwind CSS for styling.
    *   Set up the basic project structure (folders for components, pages/app router structure, utils, etc.).
    *   Initialize a Git repository and make the initial commit.

2.  **Firebase Integration:**
    *   Create a new Firebase project.
    *   Enable Firestore Database, Firebase Authentication (Email/Password provider), and Firebase Functions.
    *   Install the Firebase SDK (`firebase`) in the Next.js project.
    *   Configure Firebase client-side initialization (e.g., in a `lib/firebase.js` or similar).
    *   Set up environment variables (`.env.local`) for Firebase configuration keys (`NEXT_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_*`).

3.  **Authentication (Priority 1):**
    *   Implement user sign-up, login, and logout functionality using Firebase Authentication.
    *   Create UI components for authentication forms.
    *   Set up user session management (e.g., using React Context or Zustand) to track the authenticated user state globally.
    *   Implement protected routes using Next.js Middleware or logic within page/layout components to redirect unauthenticated users.
    *   Configure basic Firebase Security Rules for Firestore to ensure only authenticated users can write their own data.

4.  **Database Schema & Account Management (Priority 2):**
    *   Define and implement the initial Firestore database structure based on the `README.md` schema (`Users`, `SocialAccounts`). Start simply, e.g., storing basic user profile info upon signup.
    *   Create a UI section (`Accounts` page as described in `README.md`) where users can (initially simulate) connecting social media accounts.
    *   Implement logic to store references to these "connected" accounts in the `SocialAccounts` collection, linked to the logged-in user's ID.

5.  **Mock Data & Basic Analytics Display (Priority 2 & 3):**
    *   Create mock data structures simulating analytics fetched from social platforms (follower counts, engagement metrics, etc.).
    *   Implement basic data fetching logic (either client-side directly from Firestore if storing mock data there, or via Next.js API routes/Firebase Functions serving the mock data).
    *   Build the core `Analytics` dashboard component structure (`README.md`).
    *   Integrate a charting library (e.g., Recharts).
    *   Display the mock data using basic charts (like the `AreaChart` example).

6.  **Real-Time Updates & Refined Visualization (Priority 3):**
    *   (Optional, depending on complexity) If using Firestore for mock data, implement real-time listeners (`onSnapshot`) to update the dashboard dynamically (or simulate this).
    *   Refine the charts and visualizations, adding more types as needed.
    *   Implement basic filtering capabilities (e.g., selecting a date range).

7.  **AI Insights Placeholder (Priority 4):**
    *   Set up a Firebase Function endpoint (or Next.js API route).
    *   Initially, have this endpoint return static/mocked AI recommendations (e.g., "Post more videos on Tuesdays").
    *   Create a UI component on the dashboard to display these fetched recommendations. (Actual OpenAI integration comes later).

8.  **Dashboard Customization Basics (Priority 5):**
    *   Structure the dashboard UI using components that represent "widgets".
    *   (Deferring saving layout preferences to Firestore for now).

9.  **Responsive Design (Priority 6):**
    *   Continuously apply Tailwind CSS utility classes throughout development to ensure components adapt to different screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop). Test layouts frequently.

10. **Deployment Setup (Priority 7):**
    *   Configure the project for deployment on Vercel.
    *   Set up environment variables securely within the Vercel project settings.
    *   Perform an initial deployment to test the process.

11. **Initial Testing:**
    *   Set up Jest and React Testing Library for unit/integration testing.
    *   Write basic tests for core components (authentication, simple UI elements).

This plan focuses on building the core structure and features incrementally, using mock data initially as suggested in the README, and following the user story priorities. Real API integrations, full AI implementation, advanced features, and comprehensive testing (like Cypress E2E) would follow these foundational steps.

Shall we proceed with Step 1: **Foundation & Project Setup**?
